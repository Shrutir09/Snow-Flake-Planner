🌨️ Story Behind Snowflake Planner

Winter has always been a difficult season for me when it comes to productivity.

Cold mornings, low energy, and that constant feeling of laziness made traditional productivity apps feel overwhelming. Most tools expected the same level of discipline every day — even when my energy was clearly lower.

Instead of forcing myself to be productive, I wanted a system that understood winter.

That’s how Snowflake Planner was born.

I designed it to:

Respect low-energy days

Encourage small wins instead of pressure

Feel cozy, calm, and visually comforting

Turn productivity into something gentle and playful

Snowflake Planner isn’t about doing everything.
It’s about doing something — even on the laziest winter days.

❄️ One task at a time.
